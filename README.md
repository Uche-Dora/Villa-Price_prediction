# Villa-Price_prediction
This project aims to predict the prices of villas in Saudi Arabia using a linear regression model. The dataset used in this project contains various features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other amenities

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project was collected from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maha48/villas-price-dataset)  and cleaned to ensure consistency and accuracy. The dataset contains 1417 observations with 11 features.

## Linear Regression Model
Linear regression was used to predict villa prices based on the available features. The model was trained on the dataset using Ridge regression. The model was evaluated based on its mean absolute error.

## Results
The baseline mean absolute error of the model was 337212. Mean absolute error for the training set was calculated to be 132481 while that of the test was 152686.
